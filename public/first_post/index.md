In the search of deep data analytic we comes to deep machine learnig which is most famous way of finding pattern in data and predicting the future state of data pattern.

In this python based machine learning code i have written a convolution based deep learnig code of predicting and recogination of number,letter and and many more. In this code i have used tranfer learning way of predicting number and letter in real time by using c++ based one of the famous visual modulus callled Open CV. Our model are quit good in recorgining letter and number.

I have trained myprogram in my local data set i.e devanagari data set.

You can find all code in my [github](https://github.com/rockerritesh/1st-project-NEPAL-Nepali_devanagari_Classifier-Ka-Kha-Ga---Ek-Dui-Tin-)
