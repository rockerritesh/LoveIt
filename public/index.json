In this python based machine learning code i have written a convolution based deep learnig code of predicting and recogination of number,letter and and many more. In this code i have used tranfer learning way of predicting number and letter in real time by using c++ based one of the famous visual modulus callled Open CV. Our model are quit good in recorgining letter and number. I have trained myprogram in my local data set i.e devanagari data set. You can find all code in my github if(in a;a\u003e10;a++){ cout\u003c\u003ci } ","date":"2021-06-21","objectID":"/first_post/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Nepali_Devanagari_Letter_Classifier","uri":"/first_post/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Classification","date":"2021-06-21","objectID":"/second_post/","tags":null,"title":"second","uri":"/second_post/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Mathematical notation in a Hugo project can be enabled by using third party JavaScript libraries.
